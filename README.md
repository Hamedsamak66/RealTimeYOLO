YOLOVision

YOLOVision is a real-time object detection project using the YOLO model. This project can identify and track multiple objects simultaneously with high accuracy.
Features

    Fast and Accurate Detection: Utilizes the YOLO model for real-time object detection.
    Supports Multiple Object Classes: Can detect various types of objects in images or videos.
    Easy Configuration: Allows selection of the YOLO model and presets for better accuracy and speed.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    NumPy

You can install all dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

        

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation and Setup

    Clone the repository:

            

bash
git clone https://github.com/username/YoloVision.git
cd YOLOVision

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

        

    bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the pre-trained YOLO model and weights, and place them in the appropriate directory.

Usage

To run and test the project, use the following command:

        

bash
python detect.py --input path_to_image_or_video --output path_to_save_results
